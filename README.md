Malware detection and analysis using ML 
Malware detection is a crucial aspect of the information security system. Unfortunately, existing signature-based ML approaches cannot detect zero-day attacks & malware. That is why ML-based identification is required. In this research we contrast our approach to prior models for dealing with static malware analysis. We present a model that simulates the practical implementation of such a model for further investigation. We give entire sources for replicating the suggested model and its outcomes. This research  includes suggested approaches for machine learning-based malware categorization & detection and implementation guidance. Furthermore, the research can be a foundation for future work in malware analysis using ML approaches.
